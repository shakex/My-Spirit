## Gameplay summary
In MY SPIRIT, players will first be introduced by Jerry’s memoirs and start the adventure. In this game, Players use keyboard or game controller to control the main character in order to solve the puzzles and complete the adventure. The core gameplay of this game can be divided into two parts: in Prologue: 1948 and Chapter I: 1949, players can control the character to walk/jump/climb/trigger in order to win. While in Chapter II: 1974 and Chapter III: 2002, in addition to the operations mentioned above, we add ‘Out of Body’, that means players can use this function in the state of flesh, then the character’s body and soul will be separated. At this moment, players can only control the soul to go up/down/right/left. The action of the soul can also influence the real world. With the help of the soul, the character may solve the problems better, but remember that the time to keep this state is limited, Once the soul left the body for a long time, the character will die. 

> *the state of flesh: refer to the state that the soul and body are not separated.*

    * A chapter is made of several interactive loops which are grouped together into a game loop
    * The game consists of a helical game loop
    * Increase the difficulty and contents in the spiral model
    * Groove design: to make tension and keep it moderate while providing easy-to use operation for players
    * Put our story into the game; follow the example of the narrative technique in theatres
